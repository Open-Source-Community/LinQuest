# 🏴‍☠️ One Piece Treasure Hunt – Setup & Play Guide

## **1️⃣ Step 1: Create Users & Group**
Before running the script, you **must manually create** the required users and group.  
Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo groupadd strawhats
sudo useradd -m -G strawhats luffy
sudo useradd -m keeper
```

---

## **2️⃣ Step 2: Run the Setup Script**
Once users are created, run the script to set up the treasure hunt environment.

```bash
sudo ./onepiecesetup.sh
```

If the setup is successful, you’ll see:
```
✅ One Piece Treasure Hunt setup complete!
👉 Log in as 'luffy' and follow the hints to claim the treasure!
```

---

## **3️⃣ Step 3: Log in as Luffy**
Switch to **Luffy** to begin your adventure:

```bash
su - luffy
```
(Password: `pirateking`)

---

## **4️⃣ Step 4: The Hunt Begins!**
Start by checking **your first hint**:

```bash
chmod 700 /laugh_tale/vault/
chmod 700 /laugh_tale/vault/hint.txt
ls -l /laugh_tale/vault/
cat /laugh_tale/vault/hint.txt
```

📜 **Hint:**  
> "The golden key is hidden somewhere in the Stronghold. Keeper may have it..."

---

## **5️⃣ Step 5: Enter the Stronghold**
Try accessing the **Stronghold**:

```bash
ls -ld /stronghold
```
🚫 **Access Denied!**

🔑 **Solution:**  
Log in as **Keeper** to check for the golden key:

```bash
su keeper
```
(Password: `gatekeeper`)

Now, check inside the **Stronghold**:

```bash
chmod 700 /stronghold
ls -la /stronghold/
chmod 700 /stronghold/hint.txt
cat /stronghold/hint.txt
```

📜 **Hint:**  
> "Luffy, if you want the key, prove you're worthy!"

Find and unlock **`.golden_key.zip`**:

```bash
chmod 444 /stronghold/.golden_key.zip
cat /stronghold/.golden_key.zip
```
🔑 **The golden key password is revealed!**

---

## **6️⃣ Step 6: Unlock the One Piece Treasure!**
Now, return to **Luffy** and unlock the treasure vault.

```bash
su - luffy
cd /laugh_tale/vault/
ls -l
```

You’ll see **one_piece.zip**, but it’s locked!

Use the password from `.golden_key.zip` to open it:

```bash
unzip -P "onepiece123" one_piece.zip
cat one_piece.txt
```

🎉 **Congratulations! You found the One Piece!** 🎉
