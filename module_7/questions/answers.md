1. **Scenario:** Your development team has a shared directory `/project` that should only be accessible by members of the `devs` group. You need to ensure that only `devs` members can read, write, and execute files in this directory.  
   **Question:** Write the command to change the directory ownership to the `devs` group and give the group full access while restricting others.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chown :devs /project
   chmod 770 /project
   ```

2. **Scenario:** Sarah, a new team member, tries to run `deploy.sh` from the `project/scripts` directory, but the system denies execution. You check the fileâ€™s permissions and realize that the execute permission is missing. To avoid confusion in the future, you decide to grant execute permission to the file owner while keeping read-only access for others.  
   **Question:** Write the command to enable execution for the file owner while keeping it read-only for others.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod 744 /project/scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
---
3. **Scenario:** During a routine security audit, you notice that a critical configuration file `/etc/app.conf` can be accessed by other users, which is a security risk. Since this file contains sensitive database credentials, only the root user should have read and write access, while others should have no permissions.  
   **Question:** What command will set the correct permissions to ensure that only the root user can access this file?  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod 600 /etc/app.conf
   ```
---
4. **Scenario:** Your teammate `john` left the team, and their home directory `/home/john` needs to be transferred to another teammate `mark`.  
   **Question:** Write the command to change the ownership of `/home/john` to `mark`.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chown -R mark:mark /home/john
   ```
---
5. **Scenario:** A script `/scripts/deploy.sh` is not executing as expected. Upon investigation, you find that it lacks execute permissions.  
   **Question:** Write the command to grant execute permissions to the owner while keeping read-only access for everyone else.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod 744 /scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
---
6. **Scenario:** Your team keeps an important **weekly report** in `/var/data/report.txt`. However, multiple users in the `staff` group accidentally **overwrite the file content**. You need to modify its permissions so that **only the owner can edit the file**, while the group and others **can only read it**.  
   **Question:** Write the command to change the permissions of `/var/data/report.txt` accordingly.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod 644 /var/data/report.txt
   ```
---
7. **Scenario:** A junior administrator, trying to be helpful, accidentally changed all permissions on `/home/user/private.txt` to `777`, making it accessible to everyone. You need to restore its permissions so that only the owner has full access while others have **no access**.  
   **Question:** Write the command to reset the permissions and secure the file.  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod 700 /home/user/private.txt
   ```
---
8. **Scenario:** You and your team use a shared directory `/team_docs` to **collaborate** on documentation. However, every time someone adds a new file, it gets assigned to their personal group instead of the team group. You decide to ensure that all new files inside `/team_docs` automatically belong to the same group as the directory.  
   **Question:** What command will set up the directory to ensure consistent group ownership for all new files?  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   chmod g+s /team_docs
   ```
---
9. **Scenario:** Your team is working in a **secure environment**, but you notice that every new file created by users has permissions set to `rw-rw-r--`. For security reasons, you want **all newly created files** to have permissions set to `rw-r-----`.  
**Question:** What **umask** value should be set to achieve this?  
   **Solution:**  
   ```bash
   umask 027
   ```
