<span style="color: red;">*Question 1*:</span>


A civil war outbreak in **Onga Bonga Republic of Wakanda**, the legitimate government in the capital **Gogogo** was surrounded by rebels from all directions except the south gate of the city, so the government decided to withdraw and evacuate the city quickly to another city called **Yaba Yaba**, and they want to take all the important governmental files and papers with them but this process will take long time and there is no time for that. One engineer suggests to scan all the files and put them in a local repository on a computer, and send a back-up of this data to a repository established by allied forces of **Kingdom of Tears** on a safe server, so which command you suggest to be used to send the data to this safe repository??

1. git pull
2. git add .
3. git commit
4. git push

Congratulations! Mr. President of The **United Regions of Murica**, ***Francis Joseph Underwood***.
You now have full control on the government, and now your Executive of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) ***Mr. Elon Task*** is eliminating the **URM** federal agencies and haulting several transactions in the Secretary of Treasury, while doing this, they accidentally deleted or corrupted or missed (We don't know yet) some important files in the system, leading to errors in the payment system as it stops working of the Secretary of Treasury, and now it became a scandal as **URM** lost about 150bn UR Dollars in the NAKDAK Stock market due to the consequences of this crisis! Federal Security Agencies started investigations and fortunately, there was git repository in the payment system, and now the feds want to know the history of all the commits, rebases clones, etc. your mission as a President is to give *exactly 2 git commands* to help them in the investigations. Thank you my fellow Murican and God bless the United Regions of Murica!!

 Adolf is an IT employee in the **Reich Inc. for electronic burning services**, the company has various software products and recently their business were booming, so they hired many new employees, that makes Adolf want to setup git for every new employee and this cost him time, so he decided to use a bash function with dynamic values passed to it to setup it quickly, he named the function *"gitsetup()"*.
this function when used in the terminal it is used like this:


```bash
gitsetup "YourName" "you@example.com" "urFavTextEditor
```

this is the body of the function **(DON'T EDIT ANY WRITTEN THING IN IT!)**:
```bash
gitsetup()

  # Write the git 1st command here and remove the comment before you write it till and include the semicolon; "$1"
  # Write the git 2nd command here and remove the comment before you write it till and include the semicolon; "$2"
  # Write the git 3rd command here and remove the comment before you write it till and include the semicolon; "$3"

*Question 4*:


***John Xina*** is a well known wrestler in **People Republic of Zhōngguó** who is under the brutal rule of ***Hoo lee Sheet*** nicknamed by *"Winnie the poo"*
*Winnie* was meeting *"Xina"* in the **Fame Hall of Bing Chilling** when he knew from some of the guardians that Xina wanted to assassinate him using a poisoned silk robe to revenge for his Uyinur people that have been arrested by *Winnie*. When the attempt failed, Xina asked *Winnie* for mercy, so *Winnie* told him that he will accept only if he fixed some git commands taking advantage of his lack of knowledge in git,*Winnie* told him he wants a commit history that is in a linear timeline and cleaner and to fix other commands.
So Xina in his prison room asked you as a caring heartbroken soldier to help him in this life or death mission!!


***Note: Some commands maybe syntactically correct, leave it.***


here are the commands:

```bash
git check SocialCreditBranch
git merging main
git add .
git commit "Glory to CCP! Nothing happened in 1989!" # don't edit the text between quotation marks
```


fix it, or John Xina will be executed!

*Question 5*:


Who Really Wrote This Code?


You and your teammate, Sayed, are working together on his branch. You write an important piece of code, and Sayed says, "I'll commit this now!".
The problem is that the one who committed the thing is Sayed, but you are the one **who really wrote this code**!! How should you fix that?

*Question 6*:


**Vekhadimir Putout** was an ambitious leader, he built a huge army for his *Moscovite Federation* to conquer new countries and oppress any rebellion inside the federation. However, this army because of his rapid military expansions on several fronts such as *Nokhchicho de facto state* and *Free Republic of kakaistan* etc. It was a necessity for the *Ministry of Defence in Muscovy* to build a real-time GIS database based on git to show the rapid and recently territorial changes in those fronts. the Database work as the following:

1. they give every soldier a GPS tracker to know his accurate position in the battle
2. the Field commanders send daily updates based on the tracked GPS positions on the map along with other classified details that describe the type of control, date of control etc.
3. the AI engine of the ministry modify the file of the database (which is a GIS map) with this new updates without certifing or checking it, just updates it with the new information.
4. finally, the general staff of the army meet on a regular time basis and assess the new modifications then they publish the assessed and certified map.

Now you are one of those military developers that build this GIS database using git, which git command you will use to develop a functionality that shows the staff officers the difference between the map with new modifications and the last certified map?


**Hint: assume the last certified map is a pointee of the HEAD**

*Question 10*:
The indie band “Pixel Beats” (Luna, Rio, and Zara) are recording their debut album. Each member edits the same music file (track_master.mp3) on a shared laptop. Chaos erupts when Luna’s vocals overwrite Rio’s guitar solo, and Zara’s drum track disappears. They need to recover their work and collaborate without clashes!
