# Module [2] : **"CLI & Linux File System, Getting Help, Viewing Files"**

## Question 1: Navigating the Linux File System

Scenario: 
You are troubleshooting a server issue, and your manager asks you to navigate to the system logs stored in /var/log. However, you are currently in your home directory (/home/user).

Question:
Which command will take you directly to /var/log?

a) cd log
b) cd /var/log
c) cd ~/var/log
d) cd home/var/log

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 2: Finding Help in Linux

Scenario:
You're new to Linux and need to understand how the ls command works. You want to find detailed information on all its options.

Question:
Which command provides the most detailed manual for ls?

a) ls --help
b) man ls
c) info ls
d) Both b and c

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question3: Move a File

Scenario:
You are organizing system reports and need to move a file named sys_report.txt from /home/user/Documents to /var/log/reports/.

Challenge:
Write the command to move sys_report.txt to /var/log/reports/.
```bash
    # Write the command here
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 4: 

Scenario:
Organizing Project Files
You just started working as a Linux system administrator, and your manager assigns you a task to organize project files in a structured way.

**Task 1:** Create a New File
Your manager asks you to create a new text file named report.txt inside the /home/user/Documents/ directory.

Write the command to create the file.

```bash
    # Write the command here

```
**Task 2:** Move the File to Another Directory
After creating the file, your manager decides that all reports should be stored in /home/user/Reports/.

Write the command to move report.txt from Documents to Reports.
```bash
    # Write the command here

```

**Task 3:** Rename the File
Now, your manager wants the file name to be more descriptive. You need to rename report.txt to final_report.txt inside the /home/user/Reports/ directory.

 Write the command to rename the file.

 ```bash
    # Write the command here

```

**Bonus Challenge** 
After completing the tasks, list all files in the /home/user/Reports/ directory to confirm that the file has been renamed successfully.

Write the command to list the files in /home/user/Reports/.
 ```bash
    # Write the command here

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 5:

Scenario: Extracting and Reading a Compressed File
You're a junior Linux administrator, and your manager has just sent you a compressed log file named logs.tar.gz. Your task is to extract the file and review its contents. However, you don’t remember the exact commands to use, so you decide to rely on the Linux help system to guide you.
 ```bash
    # Write the commands here

```

## Question 6:

Ahmed had been working tirelessly on his new project, moving files, organizing directories, and jumping between different folders. He was so focused that he didn’t realize how deep he had gone into the file system. When he finally paused, he had no idea where he was. The terminal prompt wasn’t giving him enough information, and he didn’t want to start over. He needed a way to figure out his exact location before proceeding. What should he do?

## Question 7:

Sara was tasked with reviewing a project folder that had been passed down from a previous developer. She knew there were important files in it, but when she ran the ls command, she didn’t see as many files as she expected. She remembered hearing that Linux hides certain files—ones that start with a dot (.)—but she wasn’t sure how to reveal them. She considered checking the documentation before making any assumptions. What should she do?

## Question 8:

Nour had been using her Linux machine for years without ever thinking about disk space. But today, she received a warning: Low disk space! She knew she had to clean up, but first, she needed to find out what was taking up so much room. Instead of randomly deleting files, she wanted a clear picture of her disk usage. What commands should she use?

## Question 9:

Yousef had been taking notes for his online course, but he realized that he had been saving everything directly in his home directory. To keep things organized, he decided to move his notes to the Documents folder. However, he hadn’t created the file yet.

**Task 1:** He quickly opened his terminal and thought, First, I need to create the file.

**Task 2:** Now that notes.txt exists in his home directory, he needs to move it to the Documents folder.

**Task 3:** Later, he decides the name notes.txt is too vague. While moving the file, he renames it to meeting_notes.txt.

**Note:** This question requires three commands.

## Question 10:

Layla had been working on a new project for weeks. She had a folder called project_A where she kept all her files. Before making some big changes, she thought, What if something goes wrong? I should create a backup first.

But then she realized—she hadn’t even created the project folder yet!
What should she do first?

**Task 1:** Layla starts by creating the project directory.

**Task 2:** Inside project_A, she needs a file to document important details about the project, so she creates a README.md file.

**Task 3:** Now that her project folder is set up, she makes a backup before proceeding.

**Note:** This question requires three commands.
