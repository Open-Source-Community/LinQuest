Dear Diary,

It’s been a while since I’ve written. So much has happened, and I’m still trying to make sense of it all. The doctors say I’m recovering, but my memory is like a puzzle with missing pieces. Some things are clear, while others are just… blank.

I remember playing with Poppy. We were laughing, running around, and having fun, or at least I thought we were. Then, out of nowhere, she hit me. I don’t remember why. I don’t even remember how hard it was. All I know is that everything changed after that.

When I woke up in the hospital, I didn’t even recognize my own face in the mirror. I didn’t remember my Linux skills,my favorite foods, my friends, or even how to tie my shoes. But I remembered Poppy.

Before, Poppy was so sweet and caring. But now, things are different. Poppy doesn’t smile at me anymore. She barely looks at me. When she does, there’s something in her eyes. Guilt? Anger? Sadness? I can’t tell. I want to ask her what happened that day, but I’m scared. Scared of what she’ll say. Scared of what I’ll remember.

The doctors say my memory might come back slowly, but I’m not sure I want it to. What if I remember something that hurts even more? What if I find out that Poppy really does hate me?

But then, there are moments when I see glimpses of the old Poppy. Like yesterday, when she quietly left my favorite book on my bed. She didn’t say anything, but it felt like she was trying to say sorry. Or maybe I’m just imagining it.

I don’t know what to think anymore. I love Poppy, and I want things to be like they were before. But I also don’t know if I can forgive her for what happened. Maybe one day, when my memory is clearer, I’ll understand. Until then, I’ll keep trying to piece together who I am—and who we are.

Love,
Minty
